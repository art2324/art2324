## About Me
I’m a Computer Science student passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Secure Systems.  
Currently, I work alongside my father in building compliance-driven AI platforms, integrating DevSecOps practices with AI Governance frameworks such as ISO/IEC 42001 and the EU AI Act.

I enjoy turning theory into real-world solutions, from coding ML pipelines to experimenting with Computer Vision and LLMs.
